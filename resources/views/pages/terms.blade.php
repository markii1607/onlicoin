                        making your Onlicoin Account safe as set forth in section 6 shall continue to apply.</li>
                    <li>We reserve the right to execute any necessary terrorist financing, money
                        laundering, fraud or other illegal activity checks before authorizing any withdrawal
                        of your funds, including in relation to sending back any funds to you after you have
                        closed your Onlicoin Account.</li>

            <li><h4>Uploading Funds</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>You can upload funds by visiting the Website, logging into your Onlicoin Account
                        and complying to the relevant upload procedure. You may be given a number of
                        different upload methods, depending on which Cash in Methods you have added to
                        your Onlicoin Account and which Cash in Methods are available in your country.
                        Upload methods are payment services given by third-party financial institutions (for
                        example, the third-party direct banking service businesses) that are not part of our
                        service. We do not give assurance that the use of any particular upload method
                        made available, and may bring changes to or discontinue the acceptance of any
                        particular upload method at any time without following the process set out in
                        section 17. Notwithstanding section 8.7 below, we shall not be accountable for the
                        upload payment until we received the uploaded funds.</li>
                    <li>You may be required to answer security questions or to accomplish other
                        activities that we or the payment service provider you use to upload funds to your
                        Onlicoin Account may reasonably ask you to ensure proper authorization of an
                        upload transaction.</li>
                    <li>If you choose to upload funds using a Payment Method that may undergo to a
                        right to claim funds back (a "Chargeback") such as (but not limited to) credit or
                        debit card or direct debit, you declare that you will not use such Chargeback other
                        than for unauthorized use of the Payment Method or for a violation by us of these
                        Terms of Service which would result in you having a right to a refund of the
                        uploaded amount. Otherwise, you may not Chargeback any upload transaction or
                        authorize Chargeback of any upload transaction for any basis for which we are not
                        responsible including (but not limited to) conflict with merchants for non-delivery of
                        goods or services or insufficient balance on the Payment Method account. We
                        reserve the right to charge you fees and expenses we sustain in connection with
                        such Chargeback and any action undertaken to dispute the same. We may also
                        charge you a Chargeback fee of (INSERT AMOUNT).</li>
                    <li>If a chargeback or reversal of an upload transaction caused a negative balance
                        in your Onlicoin Account, you will be asked to repay such negative balance by
                        uploading sufficient funds into your Onlicoin Account. Failure to comply is a breach
                        of these Terms of Service. Repayment of the negative balance is due immediately
                        without any notification. We reserve the right, at any time, to give you reminders or
                        to take other debt collection measures including but not limited to mandating a debt
                        collection agency or solicitors or to pursue the claim in court. We reserve the right
                        to charge you the expenses we justifiably incur in relation to any debt collection or
                        enforcement efforts.</li>
                    <li>Uploaded funds will be credited to your Onlicoin Account after we have received
                        the funds. Some upload transactions, such as those by credit or debit card, direct
                        debit or direct banking will be credited to your Onlicoin Account instantly, yet still
                        subject to reversal if the actual funds do not reach us within a reasonable time in
                        which case we will deduct such reversed transaction from the balance of your
                        Onlicoin Account. If your Onlicoin Account balance is insufficient, we reserve the
                        right to ask for repayment from you.</li>
                    <li>For the purpose of an upload transaction through a Payment Method, we are an
                        online currency or e-money issuer and will issue e-money in exchange for the
                        uploaded funds. We will not function as a payment service provider when receiving
                        such funds.</li>
                    <li>You must not carry out an upload through a Payment Method if you are not the
                        named holder of that Payment Method. We take any violation of this requirement
                        very seriously and it will be treated as a fraudulent activity if you attempt to use a
                        Payment Method of which you are not the named holder. Without prejudice to
                        claiming further damages, if we are asked to return funds uploaded from a Payment
                        Method that is not in your name, we may charge you an administration fee of
                        (INSERT AMOUNT) per upload return.</li>
                    <li>Uploads may be subject to upload limits due to security reasons and legal
                        requirements. These limits are set dynamically depending on your verification
                        status and the upload method you choose to use. You should know that depending
                        on your verification status your upload limits may be higher than your withdrawal or
                        spending limits. You can see these limits at any time in the relevant section of your
                        Onlicoin Account profile.</li>
                    <li>Uploads are subject to fees including currency conversion fees (if applicable).
                        Please see section 13 for more information.</li>

            <li><h4>Sending Payments</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        To send a payment, it is a requirement that you authorize the payment with
                        your login information and password. We may also ask you additional security
                        questions related to you or your Onlicoin Account. If your Onlicoin Account is
                        protected by additional security measures such as password tokens, you need to
                        follow every step provided to you with such additional security measures.
                    </li>
                    <li>Every receiver of a payment you wish to send through us must have a valid way
                        that we can use for their identification. For most of our services that means of
                        identification will be a valid email address but we may still ask for other means of
                        identification for our other services.</li>
                    <li>If you are asked to provide information of the recipient’s email address or other
                        means of identification, where applicable, you must take great care to accurately
                        type the exact details of whom you wish to send money to. We use those details as
                        the unique identifier to determine the intended receiver of the payment which you
                        instruct us to process. Other details that you provide us along with the recipient’s
                        means of identification may be disregarded and we shall not be held accountable
                        for any error you make when entering the recipient’s means of identification.</li>
                    <li>If the email address of the intended recipient is already registered with us, the
                        funds will be instantly credited to the Onlicoin Account connected with that email
                        address. Once funds are transferred to the recipient’s Onlicoin Account, the
                        transaction becomes irreversible.</li>
                    <li>If the recipient’s email address is not registered with us, we will send a
                        notification email to that email address with proper instructions on how to claim and
                        receive the payment. If the recipient did not claim the payment within (INSERT NO
                        OF DAYS), the transaction will be canceled and we will return the funds to you. You
                        may also cancel the transaction at any time before the funds have been transferred
                        to the recipient’s Onlicoin Account. To cancel a transaction you should log into your
                        Onlicoin Account, find the relevant transaction in your transactions history and
                        choose “Cancel”.</li>
                    <li>
                        Payments are subject to payment limits because of security and legal
                        requirements. These limits are set dynamically depending on your verification
                        status. You can look for these limits at any time in your Onlicoin Account profile. You
                        should ensure that your limits are enough to cover the payment you intend to make
                        as well as any applicable fees including transfer charge and currency conversion
                        fees. You should know that the recipient of a payment may also be subject to
                        spending and withdrawal limits and that this may affect the recipient’s access to the
                        funds you intend to send.
                    </li>
                    <li>If we are late in completing a payment that you instruct us to make, you may
                        ask us to contact the recipient's payment service provider and ask them to credit it
                        as if it had been received on the right day.</li>
                    <li>Sending payments is subject to fees including currency conversion fees (if
                        applicable) depending on the type of payment you make and the type of Onlicoin
                        Account you have. Please see section 13 for additional information.</li>
                    <li> Third Party Providers
                        <ol>
                            <li>You may allow Third Party Providers to access your Onlicoin Account
                                information or make payments using your Onlicoin Account, provided that the Third
                                Party Provider is open and transparent regarding its identity and is acting in
                                accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements. Nonetheless, never give your
                                security details to ANY Third Party Providers, unless we say otherwise. Any
                                instruction sent by a Third Party Provider will be treated as if it were from you.</li>
                            <li>We will prevent Third Party Providers from accessing your Onlicoin Account if
                                we detect any unauthorized or fraudulent access using your Onlicoin Account. We
                                will notify you first before preventing any access and explain our reasons for
                                preventing access to a specific Third Party Provider, unless it is not practical to do
                                so, in which case, the notification comes afterward. Whatever the case may be, we
                                will notify you of the actions taken, which we deem most appropriate, given the
                                circumstances. If the reasons behind the prevention will undermine our reasonable
                                security measures or is otherwise unlawful, we will not inform you anymore
                                regarding the matter. We might provide alternative options for Third Party Providers
                                to access your Onlicoin Account. We refuse to give Third Party Providers access to
                                your account if they try to gain access via inappropriate or unauthorized ways.</li>
                            <li>Any incorrect or unauthorized payments made by your Onlicoin Account using
                                a Third Party Provider must be immediately reported to us so that we can amend
                                said transactions.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>If you receive funds into your Onlicoin Account, we notify you with an email
                        and display the payment as a “(RECEIVE MONEY)” transaction in your transactions
                        history, along with the date of receipt (the credit value date), the fees charged and,
                        if applicable, any exchange rate that was used. Each transaction is given a unique
                        transaction ID and this will be displayed in the transaction history. We will not
                        change or amend information shown in your online transaction history. You should
                        religiously reconcile incoming payments with your own records.</li>
                    <li>You should know that receipt of funds to your Onlicoin Account does not
                        automatically mean that these transactions are irreversible. We reserve the right to
                        reverse a payment if the payer or the payer’s bank or payment service provider has
                        charged back or reversed (or is reasonably likely to Chargeback or otherwise
                        reverse) an upload or other payment which was used to fund the payment to you.</li>
                    <li>If a person received a notification about a payment from us indicating that
                        someone has sent them funds to an email address that is not registered, it will not
                        be credited with the payment until it has been claimed in compliance with the
                        instructions written in the notification email. Until then, there will be no contractual
                        or fiduciary relationship between us and the intended recipient. The funds remain
                        those of the sender.</li>
                    <li>The receipt of payments is subject to fees and currency exchange fees,
                        determined by the type of payment you receive and dependent upon the type of
                        Onlicoin Account you have. Please see section 13 for details.</li>

                        include (but are not limited to): the sale of supply of dietary supplements and
                        alternative health products, live streaming, dealing in natural resources such as

                        category it falls upon. We reserve the right to add business categories, at our sole
                        discretion, to the list of allowable business categories within the Terms of Service or
                        within the Website.</li>
                    <li>We reserve the right to reverse any transaction, close or suspend Onlicoin
                        Accounts, report transactions to the relevant law enforcement agency, claim
                        damages from users, and charge administration fees of up to (INSERT AMOUNT
                        AND DENOMINATION) for any attempt to conduct transactions that violate the
                        prohibitions contained within Section 11 or are not approved under Section 11.5.</li>
                    <li>It is your sole responsibility to ensure that you send to or receive payments
                        from persons or entities that comply with any applicable laws and regulations for
                        the sale of supplies or goods and services that you provide or receive. Any
                        payments accepted or sent using our services is not an indication of the legality of
                        the sale of supplies or the provision of goods and services. Do not proceed with the
                        transaction if you have questions pertaining to the legality of any supply or

            <li><h4>Withdrawing Funds</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>You can request to withdraw all or part of the funds held in your Onlicoin
                        Account at any time. To do this you must log into your Onlicoin Account and choose
                        a withdrawal method and enter your desired amount to be withdrawn. Withdrawal
                        methods are payment services given, at least in part, by third-party financial
                        institutions (for example, the bank where you hold an account). We cannot assure
                        you the availability of any particular withdrawal method and we may make changes
                        to or discontinue a specific withdrawal method at any time without taking heed of
                        the procedure set out in section 17 as long as there is at least one withdrawal
                        method available to you. Where the withdrawal payment is received by you through
                        the help of a payment service provider (example, the bank), we shall not liable for
                        the withdrawal payment once your payment service provider received the
                        withdrawn funds.</li>
                    <li>Your Onlicoin Account is subject to withdrawal limits. These limits are
                        automatically adjusted depending on the type of identification documentation you
                        have provided us. You can look for your withdrawal limits at any time in your
                        Onlicoin Account profile. Before you upload any funds into your Onlicoin Account,
                        you must see to it that your current withdrawal and spending limits meet your
                        withdrawal and spending requirements because we legally cannot allow you to
                        exceed these limits.</li>
                    <li>If your withdrawal request surpasses your current limit, we may refuse your
                        request and instead oblige you to send us documents that will verify your identity
                        and address before we allow you to the withdrawal of funds.</li>
                    <li>Withdrawals are subject to fees like currency conversion fees if it is applicable.
                        Please see section 13 for more information.</li>
                    <li>For the purposes of a withdrawal transaction, we are a payer and not a
                        payment service provider.</li>
                    <li>You must not execute a withdrawal to a bank account or other Payment
                        Method if you are not the named holder. We take any violation of this requirement
                        very seriously and will consider any attempt to use a Payment Method of which you
                        are not the named holder as a fraudulent activity. Without prejudice to claiming
                        further damages, if we are ordered to investigate a withdrawal to a Payment Method
                        that is not in your name, we may charge you with an administration fee of up to
                        (INSERT AMOUNT).</li>
                    <li>You should make sure that the payment details you enter when withdrawing
                        funds are accurate and complete. We will not be responsible for withdrawn funds
                        being sent to the wrong account where this is caused by you providing incorrect
                        payment details. When withdrawing to a bank account, you must make sure that
                        the (ACCOUNT NUMBER, SORT CODE, ETC.) are correct. If you have withdrawn
                        funds to the wrong account, you may contact us and request that we help you in
                        reclaiming the funds. However, we will charge you an administration fee of up to
                        (INSERT AMOUNT) for doing so and we cannot assure you that the reclaim efforts
                        will be successful.</li>

            </li>
            <li><h4>Fees</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fees mainly depend on the purpose of your Onlicoin Account usage. Fees
                        differ for personal and commercial usage.</li>
                    <li>Transaction-related fees are available for viewing under the “Fees” section of
                        our website. Onlicoin Accounts used for commercial purposes have additional fees
                        associated with them, in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions
                        referred to in Section 4.7. We recommend you to print, download, and keep a copy
                        of the “Fees” section, including a copy of the Terms of Service. The “Fees” section
                        forms a part of these Terms of Service. In accordance with Section 17, fees are
                        subject to change at any time. We may charge additional fees under certain
                        circumstances, as pointed out in sections 8.3, 8.9, 8.12, 11.6, 12.6 and 12.7.</li>
                    <li>All transactions may be subject to currency conversions. Any payment from
                        your Onlicoin Account (denominated to a currency) to another Onlicoin Account
                        (denominated in another currency) will show a prompt asking you to either: a.)
                        make the payment in your currency, b.) make the payment in his currency; or c.)
                        make the payment in other currency. If you select your account’s currency (a.), the
                        recipient will pay the conversion fee to your respective currency. If you select the
                        recipient’s currency (b.), you will pay the conversion fee to his respective currency.
                        If you select a different currency instead (c.), you will pay the conversion fee for the
                        conversion to the desired currency, and the recipient will also pay the conversion
                        fee to his desired currency if he wishes to do so.</li>
                    <li>We apply the average daily inter-bank market rate, published by a third-party
                        foreign currency data provider (INSERT DATA PROVIDER) for every currency
                        conversion. In addition, we add a foreign exchange fee on top of that, which is
                        visible under the “Fees” section of the website. The foreign exchange fee is payable
                        on top of the transaction fee. We do not apply foreign exchange fee for fees in
                        (INSERT CURRENCY HERE), but rather, converts the amount in (INSERT
                        CURRENCY HERE) to your Onlicoin Account’s currency at the applicable wholesale
                        exchange rate.</li>
                    <li>Fees are expressed either as a fixed amount in (INSERT CURRENCY HERE) or
                        as a percentage of the transaction. Fixed amounts displayed in a currency other
                        than (INSERT CURRENCY HERE) are for informational purposes only. Any fees
                        deducted from a balance or a transaction denominated in a different currency will
                        be converted first into the equivalent fee for that currency (which is based on the
                        Onlicoin wholesale exchange rates applicable at the time) and then deducted.
                        Foreign exchange fees do not apply to currency conversions of fees.</li>
                    <li>Payable fees are automatically deducted from your Onlicoin Account balance.
                        Transaction fees are also automatically deducted from your Onlicoin Account
                        balance for every transaction executed. We refuse to process payments if your
                        Onlicoin Account balance is insufficient to cover the fees. Chargeback fees are
                        deducted automatically when incurred.</li>
                    <li>You are required to repay the negative balance by adding funds to your
                        Onlicoin Account if the deduction of fees results in a negative balance. Failure to do
                        so results in a breach of Terms of Service. Repayment of the negative balance is due
                        immediately without any prior notice. However, we reserve the right to send you
                        reminders at any point in time requiring you to add funds to your account or to
                        perform other debt collection methods including (but not limited to): instructing a
                        debt collection agency or solicitors to collect the debt, or to pursue the claim in
                        legal court. We reserve the right to charge you with expenses incurred reasonably in
                        connection to any debt collection or enforcement actions we have performed.</li>
